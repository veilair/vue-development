## `Introduction`

### About Vue.js: the progressive JavaScript framework
[Vue.js](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vue.js) is  is an open-source model–view–viewmodel front end JavaScript framework for building user interfaces and single-page applications.

An approachable, performant and versatile framework for building web user interfaces.
 - Approachable
> Builds on top of standard HTML, CSS and JavaScript with intuitive API and world-class documentation.

- Performant
> Truly reactive, compiler-optimized rendering system that rarely requires manual optimization.

- Versatile
> A rich, incrementally adoptable ecosystem that scales between a library and a full-featured framework.

Developed in 2016, Vue.js is one of the most versatile front-end JavaScript frameworks. It’s also known as a progressive framework due to its capability to facilitate the design of high-end single-page web applications through dual integration mode. The framework follows the MVMM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern. Besides that, Vue.js is simple, unrestricted, and an easy-to-adopt framework.   

Pros:

Quick and easy configuration due to MVVM architecture
Easy to learn, use, and understand even for beginners
Lightweight framework with a small build size
Seamless integration with third-party apps
It comes with a virtual DOM option
Cons:

Lack of high-end and effective plugins
Not suitable for extensive scaling 
Older versions of iOS and Safari browsers can cause problems
Difficulty with two-way binding 
Excessive flexibility can lead to fatal errors
